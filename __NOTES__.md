# Notes
- As of someone without a design creativity, it would be nice to have a mockup coming from the coding test to atleast give an initial look/feel for the expected output.
- Due to wanting to be able to pass this immediately and was challenged with how to make it look okay-ish, I opted to put all logic and component into one place, instead of putting them into small bits of code.
